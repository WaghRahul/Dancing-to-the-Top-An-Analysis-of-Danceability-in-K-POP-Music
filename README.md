# Dancing-to-the-Top-An-Analysis-of-Danceability-in-K-POP-Music

***Overview:***
This project aims to analyze K-Pop songs to understand their suitability for dancing. By examining various features of the songs, we predict their danceability class using a Random Forest Classifier model.

***Key Features:***
- **Data Analysis**: Analysis of K-Pop songs based on features such as song ID, title, artist, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, valence, tempo, and time signature.
- **Target Feature**: The danceability class is categorized into three classes: "Low," "Medium," and "High."
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use of a Random Forest Classifier model to predict danceability class.
- **Data Visualization**: Creation of insightful charts to demonstrate how different song attributes impact danceability.

***Skills Used:*** Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Python, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization  

***Conclusion:*** This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the danceability of K-Pop music, leveraging data science techniques to predict how suitable songs are for dancing. The insights gained can help in understanding what makes K-Pop songs so danceable and popular.
